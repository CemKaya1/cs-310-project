OUTLIFY

## Short Description
A smart wardrobe assistant that allows users to digitize their clothing, create stylish outfits, receive personalized outfit suggestions, and share their style with friends.

## Main Purpose
Outfitly addresses the timeless problem of "I have a closet full of clothes, but nothing to wear." It solves this by creating a searchable, digital inventory of a user's entire wardrobe, preventing items from being forgotten. By offering a tool to create and save outfits, it reduces the daily stress and time spent on deciding what to wear. Furthermore, its suggestion engine provides inspiration and helps users maximize the potential of their existing clothes, promoting more sustainable fashion habits.
